This repository is the root repository of the final EECS 700: IoT Security 
project. This repo holds all the (currently revoked and invalidated)
certificates, keys, etc. that were all used when the system was deployed. 

The best way for you to get acquainted with the specifics of this project
and our goals, please refer to [the paper](./sandissa.pdf) in the root directory.

Directory `v1` holds the final system details, whereas `prototype` was the
draft up of the project on the first week we were assigned it. 

Directory `v1` has submodule links to commit hashes of all dependent repositories,
such as a repository for the code that runs on smart IoT devices, on the 
intermediary server, and the frontend that the user has control of. 

File `drawn_layout.kra` is a [krita](https://krita.org) file that has a drawn
infrastructure, mostly prototype. Please see the paper mentioned above for 
the final description and report. 

Thank you.
